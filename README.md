## Yelp Dataset Analysis
This project analyzes the Yelp dataset to uncover key insights into the restaurant industry. It investigates the relationship between user engagement and business success metrics.

## Project Description
The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and understanding the factors that drive success is crucial. This project leverages a subset of the Yelp dataset to analyze the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and business performance metrics (review count, average ratings) for restaurants.

The analysis shows that a restaurant's success is driven not only by ratings and review counts but also by consistent user engagement.

## Data Overview
The analysis uses a subset of the Yelp dataset, which includes business information from eight metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada. The data is provided in JSON format and consists of five files:

- **Business**
- **Review**
- **User**
- **Tip**
- **Check-in**

The JSON files were loaded into a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** → Data processing and cleaning of large JSON files  
- **MySQL** → Relational database for storing Yelp data and efficient querying  
- **Power BI** → Visualizations and dashboards to present findings and recommendations
